        <h1>Pictures of Places</h1>

        <p>This website will walk you through places I've lived and some of the best pictures I've taken while there.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#nv">Northern Nevada</a></li>
                <li><a href="#pa">Central Pennsylvania</a></li>
                <li><a href="#wa">Seattle, Washington</a></li>
            </ul>

            <br/>
        <h2><a name="nv"></a>Northern Nevada</h2>
            <h3>It's a relief to everyone who has had to live there that Nevada is more than just Las Vegas.  Drive nine hours north and you're in the land of high desert, vast sky, and wild horses.  The Carson Valley is bound to the West by the Sierras, with Lake Tahoe just forty minutes away.</h3>

        <h2><a name="pa"></a>Central Pennsylvania</h2>
            <h3>The best description I ever read of Pennsylvania described rolling green hills dotted with coal mines like cigarette burns.  What people there call mountains are a lower elevation than the valley floor I grew up on.  The most generous thing I can say is that they are perhaps weighed down by history.</h3>

        <h2><a name="wa"></a>Seattle, Washington</h2>
            <h3>Seattle is a beautiful city.  Puget Sound and Lake Washington render it nearly surrounded by water, the novelty of which I suspect will never decrease for me.  One of the best things about Seattle is its proximity to a variety of state and national parks. </h3>
